<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 28 years old with a family and I have recently decided to switch careers and get into the tech industry as a web developer. These are a few of the roles I have worked in previously and even presently. The goal is to continue growing my skills and eventually land my dream role of being a font-end developer.</p>
